    # This hook is called after the certificates have been created but before
    # they are symlinked. This allows you to sync the files to disk to prevent
    # creating a symlink to empty files on unexpected system crashes.
    #
    # This hook is not intended to be used for further processing of certificate
    # files, see deploy_cert for that.
    #
    # Parameters:
    # - KEYFILE
    #   The path of the file containing the private key.
    # - CERTFILE
    #   The path of the file containing the signed certificate.
    # - FULLCHAINFILE
    #   The path of the file containing the full certificate chain.
    # - CHAINFILE
    #   The path of the file containing the intermediate certificate(s).
    # - REQUESTFILE
    #   The path of the file containing the certificate signing request.

    # Simple example: sync the files before symlinking them
    # sync "${KEYFILE}" "${CERTFILE}" "${FULLCHAINFILE}" "${CHAINFILE}" "${REQUESTFILE}"

    # Parameters:
    # - DOMAIN
    #   The primary domain name, i.e. the certificate common
    #   name (CN).
    # - OCSPFILE
    #   The path of the ocsp stapling file
    # - TIMESTAMP
    #   Timestamp when the specified ocsp stapling file was created.

    # - DOMAIN
    #   The primary domain name, i.e. the certificate common
    #   name (CN).
    # - RESPONSE
    #   The response that the verification server returned

    # response code that does not start with '2'. Useful to alert admins
    # about problems with requests.
    #
    # Parameters:
    # - STATUSCODE
    #   The HTML status code that originated the error.
    # - REASON
    #   The specified reason for the error.
    # - REQTYPE
    #   The kind of request that was made (GET, POST...)
    # - HEADERS
    #   HTTP headers returned by the CA

    # Simple example: Send mail to root

    # The output should be just the certificate signing request formatted as PEM.

    # Parameters:
    # - DOMAIN
    #   The primary domain as specified in domains.txt. This does not need to
    #   match with the domains in the CSR, it's basically just the directory name.
    # - CERTDIR
    #   Certificate output directory for this particular certificate. Can be used
    #   for storing additional files.
    # - ALTNAMES
    #   All domain names for the current certificate as specified in domains.txt.
    #   Again, this doesn't need to match with the CSR, it's just there for convenience.

    # Simple example: Look for pre-generated CSRs
    # if [ -e "${CERTDIR}/pre-generated.csr" ]; then
    #   cat "${CERTDIR}/pre-generated.csr"
